Key stage 2 absence and attainment overall

Filename: key_stage_2_ud_overall_absence_attainment.csv
Geographic levels: National
Time period: 2018/19
Content summary: This file contains the overall absence and attainment data at key stage 2.

Variable names and descriptions for this file are provided below:

Variable name         |  Variable description
--------------------  |  -------------------------------------------------------
attainment_ks2_rwm    |  Attainment in reading, writing and maths at key stage 2
eligible_pupils       |  Number of eligible pupils
sess_overall          |  Number of overall absence sessions
sess_overall_percent  |  Overall absence rate
sess_possible         |  Number of sessions possible

Footnotes:

1. Overall absence is calculated over all of KS2. This is equivalent to years 3, 4, 5 and 6 over academic years 2015/16 to 2018/19. Only pupils for whom valid absence data exists for all academic years have been included.
2. Includes those pupils who reached the expected standard in all of reading, writing and maths. The expected standard in reading and maths is a scaled score of 100 or above. The expected standard in writing is a teacher assessment of 'working at the expected standard' (EXS) or 'working at greater depth' (GDS).
3. Attainment categories within this analysis are mutually exclusive, therefore pupils meeting the expected standard excludes those reaching the higher standard.
4. Includes those pupils who reached a higher standard in all of reading, writing and maths. A higher standard is a scaled score of 110 or more in reading and maths and pupils assessed as 'working at greater depth' (GDS) in writing TA.
5. Enrolment level absence information has been aggregated to pupil level using a unique pupil identifier, summing all absence and possible session data for each pupil regardless of which school the sessions were accrued at. See methodology.

4. Attainment categories within this analysis are mutually exclusive, therefore pupils meeting the expected standard excludes those reaching the higher standard.
5. Percentage point bands with less than 500 eligible pupils have not been included in the chart.
6. Includes those pupils who reached a higher standard in all of reading, writing and maths. A higher standard is a scaled score of 110 or more in reading and maths and pupils assessed as 'working at greater depth' (GDS) in writing TA.
7. Enrolment level absence information has been aggregated to pupil level using a unique pupil identifier, summing all absence and possible session data for each pupil regardless of which school the sessions were accrued at. See methodology.

3. Overall absence is calculated over all of KS4. This is equivalent to years 10 and 11 over academic years 2017/18 to 2018/19. Only pupils for whom valid absence data exists for all academic years have been included.
4. Attainment categories within this analysis are mutually exclusive. Among pupils achieving a grade 4 in all components of the English Baccalaureate, some will have achieved a grade 5 or above in some components. Among those not achieving grade 9-4, some pupils will have achieved a grade 4 or above in some components.
5. Enrolment level absence information has been aggregated to pupil level using a unique pupil identifier, summing all absence and possible session data for each pupil regardless of which school the sessions were accrued at. See methodology.
